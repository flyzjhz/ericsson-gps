ericsson-gps
============
ericsson-gps opens /dev/ttyACM2, writes the correct control codes to it, forks, allocates a pseudo terminal, and copies the NMEA stream from /dev/ttyACM2 to the pseudo terminal. Useful for gpsd and Ericsson UMTS modules.

Please consider that this solution is Linux specific because I use epoll and Linux pseudo terminals. Furthermore this code is a simple dirty hack.

Building
--------
Type ``make`` and you will get an executable named ``egps``.

Usage
-----
Simply execute ``egps``
